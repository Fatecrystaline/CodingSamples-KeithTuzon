# C++ Gameplay Systems Portfolio

This repository contains a small collection of C++ projects focused on
gameplay systems, object-oriented design, and systems-style programming.

Each project is intentionally scoped to demonstrate a specific set of
technical and design concepts commonly used in game development.

## Projects

### Combat System Demo
A tick-based combat simulation demonstrating:
- Ability and cooldown systems
- Time-based status effects
- Deterministic update loops
- Separation of simulation logic and presentation

---

### RPG Item Shop
A console-based RPG item shop demonstrating:
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Inventory persistence via file I/O
- Menu-driven interaction
- Extensible item definitions

Each project folder contains its own README with build instructions and
design notes.
